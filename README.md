## eFMRL Chat
---
### Synopsis

eFMRL Chat is an app similar to Slack allowing users and developers to communicate and view messages instantly. However, eFMRL stands out because the user will only view the last 15 messages giving the user or developer an opportunity to focus on specific topics that matter. In a short time, the content will disappear and a new topic will emerge. The following packages were utilized throughout the project: 

##### * **IAM Management** for account management and permissions
##### * **DynamoDB** for persistence
##### * **CloudWatch** for logging
##### * **API Gateway** for exposing API endpoints coded up in our Node.js project
##### * **AWS Lambda** for managing our serverless lambda functions
##### * **serverless CLI**
##### * **AWS SDK for Node.js**
##### * **Express**
##### * **Socket.io**
##### * **Superagent**
##### * **johnfellows/aws-tools”: “^1.0.5"**
##### * **React”: “^16.7.0"**
##### * **React-dom”: “^16.7.0"**
##### * **React-scripts”: “2.1.3"**
##### * **socket.io-client”: “^2.2.0"**

### Motivation

eFRML chat was created due to the fact that users in the business industry and developers utilized Slack and realized that myriad of messages was loaded in a specific chat room with several topics instead of one specific topic.
